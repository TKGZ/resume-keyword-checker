Checks if keywords in a resume match those in a job description.

When applying for jobs, keywords in a resume play a big role in how the resume passes an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and actually lands on a recruiter's table.

This simple program checks
1) How many unique words are there in a job description
2) How many times those unique words are showing up in the job description (frequency). The more times a word is repeated, the more important it might be to the recruiter.
3) If a word in job description is in your resume.
4) How many words in the job description are in your resume (word coverage)
5) How much of the word frequency in the job description are covered by your resume (frequency coverage). 

This is also a good way to track what is the required level of matching keywords to pass an ATS. For that, you need to track your performance over time.
